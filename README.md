## AI Agents on the Blockchain

> This repository was created for the "AI Agents on the Blockchain" workshop in UCD.

Hi there! :wave:

In this workshop we will learn how to interact with the VeChain blockchain using [the VeChain SDK](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk). Armed with this knowledge we will build an AI Agent on [ElizaOS](https://elizaos.ai/) that understands blockchain related user prompts and interacts with the blockchain in real time. 

By the end of the workshop you will have a working agent that answers prompts like `what is my account balance?` and `what is the last transaction for account 0xabcd...?` and you will know how to extend its capabilities to answer even more complex prompts.
