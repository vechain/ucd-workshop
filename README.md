## AI Agents on the Blockchain

> This repository was created for the "AI Agents on the Blockchain" workshop in UCD.

Hi there! :wave:

In this workshop we will learn how to interact with the VeChain blockchain using [the VeChain SDK](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk). Then, we will build an AI Agent on ElizaOS that can answer complex user prompts for blockchain data such as `what is my account balance?` and `hat is the last transaction for account 0xabcd...?` in real time.
